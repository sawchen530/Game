# Capemouse (v5.9 failsafe) 

Single-file HTML game optimized for iOS Safari and static hosting.

## Quick Deploy: GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repo on GitHub (public is fine).
2. Upload **index.html** and **.nojekyll** (and this README if you like).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** / **root**
   - Click **Save**
4. Wait ~30–60 seconds, then open the Pages URL it shows.

If you use a custom domain, remember to update DNS and wait for propagation.

## Notes
- First tap enables audio on iOS. If taps are blocked, the game auto-starts after ~1.5 seconds.
- Controls: arrows/WASD, Z to jump (double jump), X to interact; on-screen buttons for mobile.
